In this File i would like to infor you that you will find the working sheets from the first Week till week8 
Some file you need to run some Libraries before running the codes such as Pandas and Numpy etc... 
There are two file which incicate the assessment Task1 and Task2. 
In the Assessment Files there are some data file you need to save them in order to run the code correclty. 
Week 1 Indorduction in Data 
Week 2 Python Variables and Data Types
Week 3 Flow Control
Week 4 Python Data Structures
Week 5 Algorithm Design
Week 6 Introduction to NumPy
Week 7 Introduction to Pandas
Week 8 is Introduction to Matplotlib and Seaborn
Task 1 is •	This programming task focuses on using Python to calculate a set of standard statistical measures for a given dataset using built-in functions and data structures ONLY.
Task 2 is •	This programming task focuses on using NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib/Seaborn to combine, clean and analyse two datasets related to student performance. 
•	Two data files have been provided for this task. These data files provide some real data from the Open University
