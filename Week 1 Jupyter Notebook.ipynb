In general, we could say a Python program is a simply a set of Python statements that read and/or write data. Variables are used for storing any data that we need in a program to achieve some goal. However, you need also to recognise that this data can come in many different forms such as numbers, strings, lists, objects, etc. This form is known as the variable's data-type. \n",

In fact, a Python variable's type can change during its lifetime by assigning a value of a different data type. However, you should avoid doing this as it can be confusing to anyone else reading your source code.\n",

It makes use of the `for` loop introduced in Week 2.  In general. list comprehensions take the form of `[<expression> for <variable> in <List>]`. Essentially, a new list is constructed by taking each element of the given `<List>` in turn, assigning it to the `<variable>` and then evaluating the `<expression>` using the value assigned to the `<variable>`.\n",

However, the key difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable, i.e. they cannot change once initialised. In addtion, tuples use `()` brackets (instead of `[]` brackets) to define their elements. Two good reasons to use a tuples over lists to store data are:\n",

    "Week 5 focuses on building algorithmic solutions to programming problems and introduces functions as a solution to help with this process. Weeks 2-4 introduce the fundamental features of the Python programming language and focus very much on practical experience of using these features. In Week 5 we will bring these features together to start solving realistic and relevant programming problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Solving\n",
    "Structured programming is a method of programming designed to help make large programs easier to read. It is aimed at improving the clarity, quality, and development time of a computer program by making extensive use of the structured control flow constructs. Python programs are composed of one or more of the following structures: Sequences, Selection and Iteration. Sequences are simply a group of python statements which are executed in sequence. Selections are choices that can be added to a program to execute sequences dependent upon some condition, e.g. if x = 5 then perform sequence A otherwise perform sequence B. Finally, iterations are sequences of statements that are repeated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea behind structured programming is to divide and conquer. As computers, technology, and software have advanced, programs have become larger and more difficult to write and maintain. Structured programming breaks down complex programs into simple tasks. The rule of thumb is that if a task is too complex to be described simply, then the task needs to be broken down further. When the task is small enough to be self contained and easily understood , then the task can be programmed. Structured programming gave rise to a number of other movements, Object-Oriented Programming being one of the more important ones. We will look at this in Week 9 of the module."

Functions can accept data when called (parameters) and give data back to the calling code (return) if required. Functions should use a name that helps a developer to understand what the functions task is. To call a function, you simple use its name, followed by `()` brackets with any parameters included inside the brackets in a comma-separated list.\n",

The NumPy API is used extensively in Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, scikit-image and most other data science and scientific Python packages. In Week 6, we will focus on this library to provide you with a working knowledge of its capabilities and usefulness to your Data Science practices.\n",

It adds powerful data structures to Python that guarantee efficient calculations with arrays and matrices and it supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.\n",

The `pip` command has two parameters, `install` and `numpy`. The first parameter requests and installation of the library named in the second parameter. Try executing the code cell.

It is the most important tool at the disposal of Data Scientists and Analysts working in Python today.\n",

Each time you execute the cell, 10000 new random values will be generated and the plot will look different. Try executing the cell a few times to validate this. Now try increasing the number of random values that are used. And execute it again. Is there any significant difference in the plot that is generated?"

    "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. In fact, behind the scenes seaborn uses matplotlib to draw its plots. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Its plotting functions operate on Pandas Dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the details of how to draw them. Available types of plot include scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, heatmaps, histograms, lineplots and many more.\n",

Next, the `load_dataset()` function is used to get access to the example dataset. This function returns a Pandas DataFrame. There are currently 18 example datasets (including the titanic dataset we used in the Pandas preview above) available. For this example, the `tips` dataset is used. This provides data about food bills, tips given and other related time/customer data. The code cell below displays this DataFrame to show you what the data looks like. "

There are various functions available for each kind of file such as `open()`, `close()`, `read()`, `readline()`, `write()` and `seek()`.

Machine Learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building from data - the ability given to a system to learn and process data sets autonomously without human intervention. It draws on aspects of statistics and algorithms to work on the data generated and extracted from multiple resources. This is achieved through complex algorithms and data management techniques like classification, regression and clustering. Broadly speaking, algorithms use either supervised learning or unsupervised learning (although there are other hybrid learning approachs). In supervised learning, all training samples have input values and a known outcome while in unsupervised learning only the input data is available.\n",
